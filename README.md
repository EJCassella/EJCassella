## Hi there 👋 I'm Elena.

**I'm looking to transition into Data Science to leverage my physics-based data skills to drive real-world impact.**

Currently, I am a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Sheffield working to develop new solar energy technologies.

I have 7 years of experience using Python to collect, clean, and analyse experimental research data.

Keep an eye out for my portfolio website coming soon.

💃 More about me:

- I love cooking! My absolute go-to dinner party food is tacos. 🌮🌮
- The tacos fuel my running and weighlifting. 🏋️‍♀️
- At the weekend you'll find me cheering on the Arsenal men's and women's teams. ⚽
